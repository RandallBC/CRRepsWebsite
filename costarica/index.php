 <h2>About Costa Rica</h2>
 <p class="compactText">Costa Rica is characterized by its impressive scenic beauty, a consolidated system of protected areas, social and political stability, high educational levels, and efficient infrastructure and services. The country has a strategic position, being located in the heart of the western hemisphere in Central America, and bordered to the north by Nicaragua, to the south by Panama, to the east by the Caribbean Sea and to the west by the Pacific.</p>

 <p class="compactText">A series of volcanic chains (cordilleras) runs from the Nicaraguan border in the Northwest to the Panamanian border in the southeast, splitting the country in two distinct climatic regions. In the centre of theses ranges is a high-altitude plain (Central Valley), with coastal lowlands on each side. Over half the population lives on this central plateau which has fertile volcanic soils.</p>
 <p class="compactText">The country offers visitors from active volcanoes to isolated tropical beaches, at both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts; From the wetlands to the last tropical dry forests reserves in our Continent, from the adrenaline rush of a world-class white water rafting to flying over the rain forest canopy - and still you need to choose the most suitable setting including rain, cloud, or transitional forests!</p>
