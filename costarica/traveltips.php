 <h2>Tips for a Safe and Pleasant Vacation</h2>
 <ul class="normalList">
  <li>Your passport is very important: take good care of it! Always carry a copy of your passport and keep the original in the safety deposit box of your hotel, along with your money, jewelry and other valuable objects.</li>
  <li>When doing bank transactions, you must present your original passport. Use only banks or authorized agencies for exchanging your money.</li>
  <li>Use automatic teller machines located in public and well illuminated places. Be careful of any offer of help or of strangers when using the machines; withdraw the cash and count it before going outside.</li>
  <li>Keep all your goods in sight and reach. If you use public transportation, always keep an eye on them.</li>
  <li>When using taxi services, verify that they comply with the legal established requirements, such as the yellow triangles printed on the doors and a meter. Always ask the staff at your hotel to call a taxi from a reliable company.</li>
  <li>If you are lost and in need of checking your map, look for a public and safe place to do it, or recur to the police authorities for help.</li>
  <li>While driving or parking your car, lock the doors and keep the windows closed. Do not leave your personal belongings inside the vehicle.</li>
  <li>If you get a flat tire, if you are suspiciously warned of a damage, if you are suspiciously hit from behind or if you are being followed while driving, do not stop and immediately look for the police or dial 911 when possible.</li>
  <li>Avoid stopping when a stranger asks you for a ride.</li>
  <li>In Costa Rica, we strive to protect our boys, girls and teenagers. The sexual exploitation of minor is a crime punished by the law.</li>
