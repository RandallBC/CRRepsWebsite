  <h2>What to Pack?</h2>
  <p class='justif'>
  What to pack will be very much be determined by the activities you will partake during your holiday and the time of the year you are visiting. Costa Rica clothing and dressing-wise is quite casual but you need to bear in mind that it is a tropical country with very high humidity conditions, with this in mind, below is a list of the items we recommend you to bring:<br/><br/>
  1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Comfortable clothes of a light material, preferably cotton. T-shirts and shorts are acceptable in San José (during the day, if planning to go out in the evening trousers are highly recommended as some restaurants will not admit you in shorts or sandals).<br/>
  2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Loose-fitting long-sleeve safari-type shirts and trousers of a quick-drying material are recommended during forest explorations or if you take any day trips out to smaller towns (Jeans tend to be more uncomfortable during long walks and get heavier when wet).<br/>
  3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pack a light sweater or jacket for San José's cool nights and early mornings and for trips up volcanoes, Monteverde, etc.<br/>
  4.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sturdy shoes or hiking boots are essential if you plan to do a lot of sightseeing and hiking (Note that some Nature reserved make it compulsory to wear closed shoes in order to visit).<br/>
  5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Waterproof hiking sandals or other footwear that lets your feet breathe are good for strolling about town, and also for beach walking, fording streams, and navigating the myriad mud holes you'll find on rain forest and cloud forest trails.<br/>
  6.&nbsp; &nbsp;A hat that provides adequate shade.<br/><br/>
  We also advise you to bring: <br/><br/>
  a. &nbsp; &nbsp; Insect Repellent.<br/>
  b. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sun screen lotion and chap-stick (spf-15 or higher).<br/>
  c. &nbsp; &nbsp; A small note book and pen.<br/>
  d. &nbsp; &nbsp; Binoculars & camera.<br/>
  e. &nbsp; &nbsp; A Torch (Most phones will have a built-in torch these days).<br/>
  f. &nbsp; &nbsp; An unlocked phone (You can get a local simcard for telephone and internet access for $2).<br/>
  g. &nbsp; &nbsp; Any medication you may require, please.<br/>
  h. &nbsp; &nbsp; Water bottle (Most hotels offer free drinking water fill-up stations).<br/>
  i. &nbsp; &nbsp; Consult with your G.P. for health advise in relation to the activities you will be doing and areas you will be visiting.<br/>
  j. &nbsp; &nbsp; Full travel insurance which covers holiday cancelation, flight delays, all activities you are partaking and any valuables you are planning to bring.<br/>
  k. &nbsp; &nbsp; And finally, a great adventurous spirit!
