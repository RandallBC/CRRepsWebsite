<h2>Its People</h2>
<p class='justif'>
The Ticos, as Costa Ricans are commonly known, are a mixing of races. Though most of the country’s 4.8 million inhabitants descend from Spanish immigrants, many families originated in other parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and, indeed, Central America. You may be surprised by the number of fair-skinned people you’ll see in the country, especially in the Central Valley. In the lowlands, more people are mestizos -that is mixture of European and Indigenous blood- whereas most along the Caribbean coast belong to an African lineage, and much of the Talamanca Mountain Range is inhabited by full-blooded Indians of various tribes. Costa Rican’s philosophy can be summarized in one phrase: “Pura Vida”, that means “full of life” and is also denoted a relaxed and easy going attitude.
