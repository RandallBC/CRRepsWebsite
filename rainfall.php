<h2>Rainfall</h2>
<p class='justif'>

In Costa Rica there are no real dry zones, because the minimum rainfall is of 1200 mm per year (48 inches ). On the other hand, there are zones with 8000 mm ( 320 inches ) of rainfall per year.<br/>
Overall, in Costa Rica two rainfall regimes can be noted:<br/><br/>
    • The Pacific (often called tropical ), characterised by a very well defined dry season from December through April and a rainy season from May to November with the heaviest rains in October.<br/>
    • The Caribbean (referred as equatorial ), with the permanent influence of the north easterly trade winds and without a dry season. In the Caribbean regime, there are 2 very different systems. On one side, the coast lowlands and northern plains, that present a notable decrease of rainfall during March and April and sometimes September, and on the other side, the mountains and slopes exposed to the trade winds, where it rains all year long without appreciable interruption (there is no defined dry season).
