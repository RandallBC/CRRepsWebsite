<h2>Temperature</h2>
<p class='justif'>

Due to the fact that Costa Rica is located between 8 and 12 degrees north of the Equator, there are no drastic changes of temperatures between one seasonal period and another, that characterize the temperate and cold zones. The major part of the Costa Rican territory enjoys thermal stability throughout the year. In some zones of Guanacaste, the increase in temperature is associated with the dry season and the large amount of daylight hours with clear skies. Temperatures vary little between seasons; the main influence on temperature is altitude. <br/><br/>
Almost ideal all year-round, the climate is a moderate 72 F. degrees in the highlands, whilst at the lowlands and coastal areas it ranges from the low 70's to the high 90's. Evenings in San Jose are free of humid heat, and beaches are cooled by ocean breezes. Pack rain gear with you, as well as light sweaters or jackets for mountainous sites such as Monteverde or the Savegre Valley. Also do not forget humidity (in some regions, like in the Caribbean or in Sarapiqu√≠, it can reach 90%). Hydration is important in the area, since you will surely sweat!
