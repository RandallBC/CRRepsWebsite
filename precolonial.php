<h2>Pre-colonial History</h2>
<p class='justif'>
Even though Costa Rica is a relative newcomer from the geological standpoint, man is an even more recent arrival. Current theory proposes that the most probable route by which humans first reached Central America was via the Bering Strait land bridge that formed with the lowering of sea level during the last of the great glacial periods, about 11,000 years ago. Little or no exact evidence exists to indicate how long our species has resided in what is now Costa Rica, but it is generally agreed that the area has been inhabited for at least the past 7,000 years. Those early dwellers in this tropical land were roaming hunter-gatherers.</p>");
