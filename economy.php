<h2>Business & Economy in Costa Rica</h2>
  <p class='justif'>
♦	Banks & Money<br><br>
There is a wide selection of state owned and privately held banks in San Jose, and most have branches throughout the country. The official currency of Costa Rica is the colon, however US dollars are widely accepted. US dollars, Euros and traveler's checks can be changed in banks. Most major credit cards are widely accepted, and cash advances can be obtained at banks throughout Costa Rica. Our recommendation is to avoid changing money at the airports and just get local currency in Costa Rica at any cash point

<br><br>♦	Business Hours<br><br>
Government offices are generally open from 8 am to 4 pm.
Banks close anytime between 3:00 and 6:00 pm, according to the bank and whether it is a main office or branch.
Most shops are open from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, while some open at 8:00 am and others close at 7:00 pm; most grocery stores close at 8:00 pm. Some shops may close for lunch, between noon and 1:00 or 2:00 pm, but these is rare.

<br><br>♦	Economy<br><br>
You do not have to travel very far in Costa Rica -- past the coffee, pastures, bananas and other crops – before realizing that agriculture is the basis of its economy. Coffee has historically been the country's most important crop, and Costa Rica continues to produce some of the finest coffee in the world. However in recent years less traditional crops have been playing an increasingly important economic role. Bananas are aso important export crop, with vast plantations covering parts of the Caribbean lowlands, there is also significant land dedicated to the cultivation of pineapples, cacao, sugar, oranges, rice, hardwoods and ornamental plants, as well as raising cattle for beef and dairy products.
<br><br>♦	Though agriculture remains the basis of the national economy, Technology and tourism remains an important industry which continues to grow providing new employment opportunities, and stimulating the conservation of our complex biodiversity.
