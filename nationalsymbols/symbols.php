									<p>The traditional ox-cart was recognized by law as a National Symbol in 1988 in the presidential administration of Dr. Oscar Arias Sánchez. The oxcart is the symbol of the Costa Rican artisanal work, symbolizing its culture of peace and the work, this is to say, humility, patience, sacrifice, perseverance in the desire to reach their goals. The way each ox-cart is uniquely hand-painted is one of the most genuine folkloric manifestations of the Costa Rican people, from the decorations of the sides, floodgates, wheels and the Yoke -  all in live and brilliant colours, constituting an artistic popular, autochthonous and spontaneous expression.  It can be affirmed that there are not two carts coloured identically!</p>

									<p>The clay coloured robin or yigüiro can measure approximately between 22 and 24 cm. This Turdus gray bird was declared national bird in 1977, as a tribute to its distinctive and melodious singing that accompanies the beginning of the rainy time.  The reasons that motivated the declaration of the yigüirro as National Bird, are based on the familiarity of the Costa Ricans with this bird for a long of time, due to the fact that it inhabits very near the to houses and his name is mentioned in typical songs, stories and by Costa Rican authors' literary works as Juan Varela and Marcos Ramírez.</p>

									<p>The “Guarianthe Skinneri” orchid was declared a national flower in 1938 under the presidency of León Cortés Castro. This epiphyte of temperate weather, is the most cultivated orchid in Costa Rica and the second week of March is its official week, this as it is the time when its blooming is at its best on the Pacific slopes of the country in the pre-mountain humid forests from 500 up to 1000 metres above sea level.    It is not surprising that this purpled orchid was chosen as national flower, since before Columbus Indians and the first settlers appreciated them, the native women liked to adorn their heads, with this orchid’s big purplish flowers.</p>

									<p>The Guanacaste tree was declared as National Tree in 1959 under the presidency of Mr. Mario Echandi Jiménez. The captive Guanacaste is recognizable at first sight, with an elegant silhouette and in parasol form and resisting the strongest of winds. The tree is a symbol of stability and growth, irradiating strength to its surroundings, solemnity and power.
 <br/>In Costa Rica, the “Guanacaste” tress are found from the coast regions at sea level up to 900 metres above sea level. The word “Guanacaste” derives from the “nahuati” root word “quatil” which means tree and the word “nacaztli” which means ear, that is to say tree of the ear, given its ear-shaped fruit
