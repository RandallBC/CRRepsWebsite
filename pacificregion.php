<h2>Pacific Region</h2>
<p class='justif'>

The fundamental characteristic of the climate of the Pacific is the presence of a dry season that lasts for 4 months and more in some zones. Also there is an important characteristic, a short dry period during half of the year, known as “veranillos” (See “little summers” section)<br/><br/>
Rainy Season<br/>
During this period, the Pacific region is inside the convergence zone, where the winds from the west strengths those already existing and produce the rainy season with all its intensity. This period extends from mid-May to the end of November, and it is only interrupted by the veranillos. (little summers).<br/><br/>
Rainfall in the Osa Peninsula<br/>
The region of the South Pacific receives considerably more rainfall than Guanacaste and the north of Puntarenas, and so much more than many localities of the Caribbean. Nevertheless, different than the Caribbean, this region has a period with a defined decrease of rainfall.<br/><br/>
Storms in the Pacific<br/>
During the summer in the north ( from July to end of November ), frequently, zones of low pressure are formed in the Caribbean region, where winds are produced that rotate in opposition to clockwise to the center of the depression. This produces strong winds and rain in the Pacific Region that rarely may turn into hurricanes.
