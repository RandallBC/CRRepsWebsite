<h3>5. Changes in Bookings</h3>
<ol class="tcList3">
<li>Some providers may penalise changes to travel plans, flights and tour dates. Each itinerary is designed cosidering specific conditions, seasons and therefore changes may result in extra costs which will be added to the modified and updated quoted. All changes made to the itinerary during the client's arrival will be handled directly with the client and the respective extra costs charged directly to the client.</li>
