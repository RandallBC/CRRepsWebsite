<h3>5. Reimbursements &amp; Refunds</h3>
<ol class="tcList3">
    <li>No refunds, either in part or in full, will be made for unused services or services partially used (air tickets, ground transportation, tours, meals, guiding, accommodation or sightseeing tours not taken, etc.) resulting from last minute cancellations or no-shows.</li>
    <li>For travel agents with whom we have a regular flow of bookings, any applicable refunds will be made in the form of credit notes to be applied to future services booked. This is in order to avoid additional bank fees, wire transfer charges and administration costs.</li>
    <li>When a refund applies due to cancellations with unpenalised balance, and a cash refund is requested in the form of a wire transfer, a U.S. $75.00 fee will be deducted of the corresponding amount to cover emisor bank fees, wire transfer charges and administration costs. Please note that intermediary and destinatary bank wire transfers fees are not contemplated in the above fee.</li>
