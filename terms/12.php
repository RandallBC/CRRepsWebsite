<h3>2. Validity of Prices</h3>
<ol class="tcList3">
    <li>Costa Rica Reps will honour quoted prices when your reservations is received in writing, availability of all quoted services and rates have been confirmed by suppliers and you have the confirmation from us that your reservations has been confirmed. We strongly recommend that quotes are confirmed within 7 days after they are presented to you.</li>
    <li>Should a booking be confirmed and paid in full, Costa Rica Reps will take over the overall price increase to a maximum of a 2.5% of the total quote. If the price increase is due to changes in goverment regulartions or any condition which would be unforseeable to us, we will inform you of such cost. If the booking has not been paid and there is a change in rates or extra costs, these will be paid by you as we have no way to commit our providers to maintaining their rates since we have not paid them. For example, when there have been excessive increases in international fuel prices, transport providers and airlines will maintain old prices only if we have already paid them.</li>
    <li>All prices asume a 5% cash pre-payment discount.</li>
    <li>Wiretransfers and Cheques are considered cash payments.</li>
    <li>Catalogue and website prices are accurate and available at time of publication.</li>
    <li>Prices do not include internal flight airfares, overland excess luggage transportation (when taking local flights), airport departure taxes, alcoholic drinks and any other extra unless otherwise stated and specifically noted in your quote.</li>
    <li>Costa Rica Reps reserves the right to increase and/or adjust prices to reflect changes in land services (landslides, floods, etc.), local airfares, service schedules, fuel price increases, land services or increases in local taxes.</li>
