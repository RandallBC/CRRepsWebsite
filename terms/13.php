<h3>3. Making reservations</h3>
<ol class="tcList3">
    <li>All new reservations must be sent in writing via fax to (506) 2520-0323 or e-mail to sales@costaricareps.com indicating the exact itinerary or quote you want to book and noting client names (or al least lead client name) and all the specifications of the client's requests including: Ages, exact travel dates, number of rooms and respective occupancies and the corresponding booking reference number/code from your company.</li>
    <li>Any special requirements (e.g. extra beds, A/C, etc), medical condition, expectations or remark must be indicated at the time of booking. We will not be responsible for situations arising from us not having been informed of existing requirements, conditions or remark which were not made at the time of booking. Any update made at a later date after your quote has been sent or reservation is confirmed may result in changes in pricing due to any extra costs required to accommodate your requests. We will pass on all your special requests, medical conditions and remarks to all suppliers, whilst we will do every effort to accommodate your special requests, we cannot guarantee the availability of services being provided under those conditions. Should a condition be a strict condition of travel we must be notified at the time of making your quote request and before confirming your booking since cancellation and modification penalties apply.</li>
    <li>It is very important that exact day and time of arrival and flight details are sent at the time of submitting your reservation so we can thoroughly consider your booking and evaluate the logistics including excess luggage transportation. Costa Rica Reps will not asume any resposibility in extra cost resulting from services that are required as a result of flights timings which we couldnot take into consideration at the time of quoting or processing your booking.</li>
