<b>Drinking water & Showers</b><br/>
In Costa Rica tap water is safe to drink almost everywhere, however it is advisable to drink only bottled water when in doubt, specially in more rural areas. The best way to enjoy your flight and your vacation is to drink lots of water! At sea level, the human body loses about a quart of water a day through air expired from one's lungs and through the skin. At flight levels and higher desert and mountain elevations, this loss can be up to 100% greater. This water has to be replaced in order to avoid dehydration and its symptoms, so make sure you drink plenty of pure water.<br/><br/>
<b>Vaccines and Immunizations</b><br/>
The risk of malaria is low in Costa Rica, but still you should avoid mosquito bites to prevent malaria. Some travellers to certain areas who are at higher risk for complications from malaria (such as pregnant women) may need to take extra precautions, like antimalarial medicine.<br/> Although there is no risk of yellow fever in Costa Rica. The government of Costa Rica requires proof of yellow fever vaccination only if you are arriving from a country with risk of yellow fever, for instance Peru, Ecuador, Guyana, etc . This does not include the US, U.K. or most Western Europe.
