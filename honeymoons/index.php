 <p class="compactText">We have hand-picked the most romantic and distinctive hotels, not only for their own charm and style; but for their unique natural settings which is often a highlight in itself... with impressive views at the top of a hill surrounded by lush vegetation or a place where you can gaze at the Pacific Ocean's blue waters.

 <p class="compactText">C.R. Reps aims to provide first class facilities, whilst giving couples the independence and freedom to choose when and how they want to travel between each destination.</p>
 <p class="compactText">The prestigious American magazine, Modern Bride, in the seventh World Best Honeymoon Destinations 2003 opinion poll chose Costa Rica as the &quot;Best Adventure&quot; honeymoon destination during 2003 and writes:</p>
 <img class="photoLeft" src="../images/tabacon1.jpg" style="padding-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 5px" />
 <p class="quoteText" style="padding-top: 30px">&quot;This Central American country is an eco-loving couple's dream come true, filled with tropical rain forests, pristine coastlines (Pacific and Caribbean) and mountainous jungles teeming with wildlife.&quot;</p>
 <p class="compactText">No doubt, Costa Rica is a country for honeymooners to experience the romance and capture the moment in every sunrise and sunset, in every sunny day and warm nights, in sparkling skies and spectacular panoramic sights of the coast... walking on secluded beaches whilst admiring the lush vegetation. A moment of magic, a memory that will last a lifetime!</p>
