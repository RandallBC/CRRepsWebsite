<h2>Food & Cuisine</h2>
<p class='justif'>
Due to its geographical location and climate, Costa Rica has a wide variety of fruits and vegetables; which when combined with the interplay of native and European ingredients translate into unique Costa Rican flavours. The basics of the Costa Rican diet are: rice, beans, and tortillas, which consist primarily of corn. Main dishes include plenty of meats from poultry, beef, fish and pork. As for seasoning, Costa Rican food is primarily spiced up with garlic, onion, sweet peppers, oregano and fresh coridander.<br/>
Costa Rican cuisine is also characterized by its' mildness and comes as a surprise to many visitors who might have travelled through Mexico and expect to find the same love spicy chillies in Costa Rican foods. Chillies are used to some degree, however, they are most commonly used in hot sauces with accompany broiled meats and poultry.<br/>
Cassava, commonly known as ''yucca'' frequently accompanies lunch and dinner meals. In many dishes yucca is often substituted for potato, perhaps boiled and mashed, fried to exquisite crispness to accompany meat and sandwiches instead of fries, or simply boiled and served with butter and garlic. Another Costa Rican favourite is Plantain, a larger type of banana which when ripe is eaten fried or grilled stuffed with cheeese or as a “Patacon” fried when still green.<br/>
<br/>♦	<b>Breakfast</b>: A traditional Costa Rican breakfast consists of ''gallo pinto'' (Pinto Rooster), eggs, tortillas and sour cream, with coffee and fresh fruit juice. Most restaurants will offer some international options.<br/>
<br/>♦	<b>Lunch</b>: Typically known as ''casado'' (Married), includes: rice and beans, one choice of meat (beef, chicken, pork, or fish), salad, fried plantain (a type of banana, very sweet and very tasty).<br/>
<br/>♦	<b>Dinner</b>: is pretty much whatever you like, and fish and seafood here is excellent, well priced, and fresh, as are the fruits and vegetables. Of course Costa Rica produces some of the finest coffee in the world!.
