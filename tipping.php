<h2>Tipping in Costa Rica</h2>
<p class='justif'>

The word for tip in Spanish is ''propina'' and is defined as a synonym of ''reward.'' It comes from the Latin word ''propinare'' which means to give something. Although Tipping is traditionally not customary in Costa Rica, personal working in the travel industry has come to somehow expect it and see it as a statement. It is not accustomed to tip Taxi drivers, but sure they will appreciate a tip.
 Tipping is entirely up to you and at your discretion based on the level of service, whether or not you feel comfortable giving tips, and your travel budget are all important factors. In case of Restaurants, it is required by law that 13 tax and 10% tip is automatically charged on the bill. Unless expressly requested, tips to your Tour guides, local guides, driver, watercraft personnel, local guides, waiters, porters and bellmen are not included on any trip quote. When included this will be clearly noted. Below we provide some overall guidelines, merely as a suggestion:<br><br>
♦	US $4.00 up to US $6.00 per traveler per day for the Tour Director or driving tour-guide.<br>
♦	US $3.00 up to US $4.00 per traveler per day for a local guide doing a full day tour, this could be a river guide, Canopy or Specialist guide or boat tour guide.<br>
♦	US $2.00 up to US $3.00 per traveler per day for the non-bilingual driver<br>
♦	US $1.00 up to US $1.50 per bag, at check-in and check-out for Bellboys.<br>
♦	US $0.50 - $1.00 per night for Chamber maids<br><br>
The above information are guidelines based on some travellers tendendy and markets, so please base your tipping on what you feel comfortable. We suggest that any tips should be handed directly to each person on an individual basis. In case of group tours, we advise to organize a group collection.
