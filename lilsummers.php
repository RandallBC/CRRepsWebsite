<h2>Little Summers</h2>
<p class='justif'>

“Veranillo de San Juan” and “Veranillo de la Canícula” are temporarily dry periods within the reainy season and although in Costa Rica both are referred to as the same thing, each one corresponds to very different climatic phenomeno.<br/><br/>
    ♦ “El Veranillo de San Juan” which means “San Juan’s short summer” coincides with the San Juan Bautista day (24 de junio) and lasts between 3 and 5 days around June 20th to 25th and it is the result of a low pressure atmospherial formation in the Pacific Ocean only a few kilometres away from the coastline which pulls the rains away from the mainline. It appears as a sudden cease of rains, with very sunny days and warm nights.<br/><br/>
    ♦  “La Canícula short summer” appears from July 15th through to August 15th every year and it is a result of the Bermuda’s anticyclon which is an enormous high pressure atmospherical condition over the Caribbean Sea which border reaches Costa Rica and manifests as a dense airwall which temporarily blocks the rain coming from the Pacific coast. It can manifest as an unstable time with sudden changes in winds, clouds, humidity and temperature during the same day.
