    Costa Rica Reps is committed to the implementation of sustainable practices and environmental conservation, seeing responsible travel as a way of preserving our natural and cultural heritage.  At Costa Rica Reps, we strive to leaving a positive environmental footprint in the communities we work with, as well as contributing to preserve their ecosystems. This is why we were one of the first companies in Costa Rica to become a strategic allied partner of Rainforest Alliance® and to achieve the highest rcognition as a fully certified as a Sustainable Travel Operator by the Costa Rican Travel Authority’s Certification in Sustainable Tourism (CST).<br/> 
    As part of its day to day business and operational practices, Costa Rica Reps strives to create environmental awareness and inspire its staff, clients, guests and partners to implementing practical actions which are tangible and quantifiable such as reducing waste, recycling and paying our suppliers fair prices.  As leaders in the travel industry, this is where our Commitment starts.<br/><br/>
