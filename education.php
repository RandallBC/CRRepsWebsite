<h2>Costa Rican Education</h2>
<p class='justif'>

The Costa Rican government has long dedicated a significant portion of its national budget to education and other social services, a policy whose result has been a healthy and educated populace.<br><br> The country has a literacy rate and average life expectancy that are much closer to those of Western European nations than most Latin American countries. <br><br>Costa Rica has had a socialized medical system for nearly half a century, and while schools and clinics are found throughout the country, the Central Valley has several public universities and dozens of private universities.<br><br> Travelers are more likely to encounter more educated people, and do not have to worry about most of the diseases they would expect to encounter in a tropical country. <br><br>For those few travelers that do become sick or injured while in Costa Rica, there are hospitals and private clinics in San Jose provide a level of care comparable to that found in the United States, and for considerably less money.
