<p class='justif'>

Costa Rican is a democracy and its system of government is very similar to that of the United States of America. There are three branches of government: Executive, which consists of the president, two vice presidents and cabinet; the Legislative Assembly, with 57 individually elected deputies; and, the Judicial Branch, which consists of civil, criminal, appellate and constitutional courts. <br><br>The President and members of the Legislative Assembly are elected for four-year terms and the president can't run for reelection.<br><br>
The current President is Mr. Carlos Alvarado Quesada (2018-2022) appointed during the democratic re-elections held on 1st April 2018.
