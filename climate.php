<h2>Climate in Costa Rica</h2>
<p class='justif'>

Costa Rica benefits from a perfect tropical, never-ending-spring climate. The average temperature is 70°F (around 21°C) in the highlands.  Lowland temperatures range from the high 70’s to the low 90’s (21 to 28°C). Consider that Costa Rica is located in the Tropics and even during the rainy season mornings are, more often than not, you can normally be assured of sunny and bright mornings followed by some rain in the afternoons or evenings, and even plenty of days without rain. Equally, expect also occasional showers even during the dry season!
