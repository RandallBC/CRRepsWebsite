<h2>Climate in Costa Rica</h2>
<p class='justif'>
Costa Rica benefits from a perfect tropical, never-ending-spring climate. The average temperature is 70°F (around 21°C) in the highlands.  Lowland temperatures range from the high 70’s to the low 90’s (21 to 28°C). Consider that Costa Rica is located in the Tropics and even during the rainy season mornings are, more often than not, you can normally be assured of sunny and bright mornings followed by some rain in the afternoons or evenings, and even plenty of days without rain. Equally, expect also occasional showers even during the dry season!

<h2>Pacific Coast</h2>
<p class='justif'>
On the Pacific Coast, the rainy season goes from May to November, whilst the dry season lasts from December to April. The Pacific side and central parts of the country are driest from January through March. There is a frequent misconception of our ''rainy season'', imagining that it's ''monsoon-like'' and that it never stops raining. Nothing could be further from the truth!

<h2>Caribbean</h2>
<p class='justif'>
On the Caribbean, the rainy season goes from November to August, being September and October the drier and sunnier months. The Atlantic or Caribbean side is driest from February through April, with a short ''summer'' in June and July, and the wettest months from November through January. However, you should be prepared for rain at any time during the year in this part of the country.
