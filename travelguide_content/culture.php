<h2 id="titulotexto">Heritage &amp; Culture</h2>
Costa Rican culture is in many ways a reflection of its racial diversity. The predominant influence has long been European, which is reflected in everything from the official language -- Spanish -- to the architecture of the country&#39;s churches and other historic buildings. The indigenous influence is less visible, but can be found in everything from the tortillas that make part of a typical Costa Rican meal, to the handmade ceramics sold at roadside stands. An important aspect of Costa Rica&#39;s cultural legacy is their love for peace and democracy. The Ticos like to stand out that their nation is the exception in Latin America, where military dictatorships have long dominated politics. 
</br>They take pride in having more than one hundred years of democratic tradition, and almost half a century without an army. The army was abolished in 1948, and the money the country saves by not expending in military issues is invested in improving the Costa Ricans&#39; standard of living, which has fostered a culture of social peace that makes it such a pleasant place to visit. 
</p>
<p><b>Pre-colonial History</b></br>
Pre-Columbian History: Even though Costa Rica is a relative newcomer from the geological standpoint, man is an even more recent arrival. Current theory proposes that the most probable route by which humans first reached Central America was via the Bering Strait land bridge that formed with the lowering of sea level during the last of the great glacial periods, about 11,000 years ago. Little or no exact evidence exists to indicate how long our species has resided in what is now Costa Rica, but it is generally agreed that the area has been inhabited for at least the past 7,000 years. Those early dwellers in this tropical land were roaming hunter-gatherers.
</p>
<p><b>Food & Cuisine</b></br>
Due to its geographical location and climate, Costa Rica has a wide variety of fruits and vegetables; which when combined with the interplay of native and European ingredients translate into unique Costa Rican flavours. The basics of the Costa Rican diet are: rice, beans, and tortillas, which consist primarily of corn. 
</p>
<p>The ingredients used by Costa Rican cooks include simple native foods, such as &quot;chayote&quot; (squash), avocados, and the ever present corn. Costa Rican cuisine is also characterized by its&#39; mildness and comes as a surprise to many visitors who might have travelled through Mexico and expect to find the same love spicy chillies in Costa Rican foods. Chillies are used to some degree, however, they are most commonly used in hot sauces with accompany broiled meats and poultry. Costa Rican food is seasoned with garlic, onion, sweet peppers, fresh coridander piced with tubers, such as sweet potatoes and cassava, commonly known as &quot;yucca&quot; frequently accompany lunch and dinner meals. 
</p>
<p>In many dishes yucca is often substituted for potato, perhaps boiled and mashed, fried to exquisite crispness to accompany meat and sandwiches instead of fries, or simply boiled and served with butter and garlic. Plantains, a type of banana, are another Costa Rican favourite, and are most often boiled, mashed, stuffed with cheese, or fried to accompany meats or bean dishes. Unlike bananas, plantains are much larger and need to be cooked to be eaten. Costa Rican diet also includes plenty of meats including: Poultry, fish, beef and pork.. do not expect to find any Ecuadorian or Peruvian delicacy!!
</p>
<ul type=none><li><i>Breakfast</i>: A traditional Costa Rican breakfast consists of &quot;gallo pinto&quot; (Pinto Rooster), eggs, tortillas and sour cream, with coffee and fresh fruit juice. Most restaurants will offer some international options.
</li>
<li><i>Lunch</i>: Typically known as &quot;casado&quot; (Married), includes: rice and beans, one choice of meat (beef, chicken, pork, or fish), salad, fried plantain (a type of banana, very sweet and very tasty).
</li>
<li><i>Dinner</i>: is pretty much whatever you like, and fish and seafood here is excellent, well priced, and fresh, as are the fruits and vegetables. Of course Costa Rica produces some of the finest coffee in the world and it&#39;s not uncommon to see bumper stickers around proclaiming that &quot;Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee&quot;

</br>
<p><b>Its People</b></p>
<p>The Ticos, as Costa Ricans are commonly known, are a mixing of races. Though most of the country&#39;s 4.6 million inhabitants descend from Spanish immigrants, many families originated in other parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and, indeed, Central America. You may be surprised by the number of fair-skinned people you&#39;ll see in the country, especially in the Central Valley. 
</p>
<p>In the lowlands, more people are mestizos -that is mixture of European and Indigenous blood- whereas most along the Caribbean coast belong to an African lineage, and much of the Talamanca Mountain Range is inhabited by full-blooded Indians of various tribes.
</p>
<p><b>National Holidays</b></p>
Though government offices and most banks close on national holidays, this causes little inconvenience to travelers, since money and traveler&#39;s checks can be changed at most hotels. We recommend that you do not change money on the street. There are days when hardly anything will be open, such as Christmas, New Year and often a couple of days preceding, and during Holy Week from Wednesday to Easter Sunday. 
</p>
<p>Some holidays can be attractive for travelers, such as the last week of the year, when there are parades and many other activities in San Jose and throughout the country. On July 25 every year (the annexation of the province of Guanacaste), the main towns in this northwest province are overflowing with revelry and folklore. Carnival, which is celebrated in the Caribbean port of Limon during the week of October 12, is another colorful affair.

<p><b>National Symbols</b></p>
<p><b>The typical Ox-cart</b></br>
The traditional ox-cart was recognized by law as a National Symbol in 1988 in the presidential administration of Dr. Oscar Arias Sánchez. The oxcart is the symbol of the Costa Rican artisanal work, symbolizing its culture of peace and the work, this is to say, humility, patience, sacrifice, perseverance in the desire to reach their goals. The way each ox-cart is uniquely hand-painted is one of the most genuine folkloric manifestations of the Costa Rican people, from the decorations of the sides, floodgates, wheels and the Yoke -  all in live and brilliant colours, constituting an artistic popular, autochthonous and spontaneous expression.  It can be affirmed that there are not two carts coloured identically! 
</p>
<p><b>Clay-coloured Robin</b></br>
The clay coloured robin or yigüiro can measure approximately between 22 and 24 cm. This Turdus gray bird was declared national bird in 1977, as a tribute to its distinctive and melodious singing that accompanies the beginning of the rainy time.  The reasons that motivated the declaration of the yigüirro as National Bird, are based on the familiarity of the Costa Ricans with this bird for a long of time, due to the fact that it inhabits very near the to houses and his name is mentioned in typical songs, stories and by Costa Rican authors&#39; literary works as Juan Varela and Marcos Ramírez.
</p>
<p><b>Purple Orchid</b></br>
The &quot;Guarianthe Skinneri&quot; orchid was declared a national flower in 1938 under the presidency of León Cortés Castro. This epiphyte of temperate weather, is the most cultivated orchid in Costa Rica and the second week of March is its official week, this as it is the time when its blooming is at its best on the Pacific slopes of the country in the pre-mountain humid forests from 500 up to 1000 metres above sea level.    It is not surprising that this purpled orchid was chosen as national flower, since before Columbus Indians and the first settlers appreciated them, the native women liked to adorn their heads, with this orchid&#39;s big purplish flowers.
</p>
<p><b>Guanacaste Tree</b></br>
The Guanacaste tree was declared as National Tree in 1959 under the presidency of Mr. Mario Echandi Jiménez. The captive Guanacaste is recognizable at first sight, with an elegant silhouette and in parasol form and resisting the strongest of winds. The tree is a symbol of stability and growth, irradiating strength to its surroundings, solemnity and power.
</p>
<p> In Costa Rica, the &quot;Guanacaste&quot; tress are found from the coast regions at sea level up to 900 metres above sea level. The word &quot;Guanacaste&quot; derives from the &quot;nahuati&quot; root word &quot;quatil&quot; which means tree and the word &quot;nacaztli&quot; which means ear, that is to say tree of the ear, given its ear-shaped fruit.
