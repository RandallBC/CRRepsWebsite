<h2>Winds</h2>
<p class='justif'>

Because Costa Rica is located in the northern hemisphere, the dominant winds of its climate are the north easterly trade winds.<br/><br/>
The Northern Winds<br/><br/>
The northern winds are cold and dry winds that blow in our national territory in December and January. Because of the cold weather in the North American continent during this time of the year, the zone of high pressure intensifies to a latitude approx. 30 degrees North and these winds descend to the south reaching our territory. These cold and dry winds penetrate until the Central Valley in Costa Rica, producing the typical climate of the end of the year.
