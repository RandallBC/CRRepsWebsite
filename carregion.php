<h2>Caribbean Region</h2>
<p class='justif'>

The whole region is directly exposed to the north easterly trade winds, which are fully loaded with the humidity of the Caribbean Ocean. Part of this humidity precipitates in the coasts and plains, but the major rainfall occurs in the slopes of the range of mountains due to the topographic effect where winds slowly lose temperature condensation and the subsequent rainfall.<br/>
This rainfall regime will decrease during 2 periods of the year, March-April and August-September, because of modifications produced in the tradewinds by the relative position of the sun. The highest rainfall occurs in the mountains, particularly between 1000 and 2000 meters (3000 and 6000 feet) of altitude, with major precipitations of 5000 mm (200 inches). <br/><br/>
<b>Storms in the Atlantic</b><br/>
They correspond to a variable period (up to 15 days) in which rain and drizzle predominate that could last all day and night. They occur mainly during the winter and in the north.
