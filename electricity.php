<h2>Electricity</h2>
<p class='justif'>

The Costa Rican electricity network is administrated by I.C.E. (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad).<br><br>
Despite its varied and rough terrain, electricity is available in 97% of the territory. Currently I.C.E. is implementing a pilot program to provide solar panels to homes which have no access to the conventional electricity network.<br><br>
Standard current is 110 volts, 60 Hertz and Costa Rica uses the exact same electrical socket standard as U.S.A. so adaptors are required.<br><br>
Costa Rica is a tropical land with regular rainfall, specially between May and November and  lighting strikes are common â€“ these may result is occasional blackouts.
