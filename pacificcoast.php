<h2>Pacific Coast</h2>
<p class='justif'>

On the Pacific Coast, the rainy season goes from May to November, whilst the dry season lasts from December to April. The Pacific side and central parts of the country are driest from January through March. There is a frequent misconception of our ''rainy season'', imagining that it's ''monsoon-like'' and that it never stops raining. Nothing could be further from the truth!
