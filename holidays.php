<h2>National Holidays</h2>
<p class='justif'>
Although government offices and most banks close on national holidays, this causes little inconvenience to travelers, since dollars are widely accepted. We recommend that you do not change money on the street. There are days when hardly anything will be open, such as Christmas, New Year and often a couple of days preceding, and during Holy Week from Wednesday to Easter Sunday.<br/> 
Some holidays can be attractive for travelers, such as the last week of the year, when there are parades and many other activities in San Jose and throughout the country. On July 25 every year (the annexation of the province of Guanacaste), the main towns in this northwest province are overflowing with revelry and folklore. Carnival, which is celebrated in the Caribbean port of Limon during the week of October 12, is another colorful affair.
