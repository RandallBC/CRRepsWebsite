<h2>Altitudinal Variation</h2>
<p class='justif'>

The parameter that does produce temperature changes is the altitude, and because Costa Rica is a country with great altitudinal variations (from sea level to more than 3800 meters ). In the highlands the temperatures are low during the whole year. At high elevations the temperature can drop many degrees during the coldest hours of the night, ( in the highest points the temperature can go below 0 C ) but increase with the sunlight during the daylight.<br/><br/> 
At the other extreme to this situation are the lowlands, where temperatures do not descend less than 20 C and not higher than 30 C. In the major part of the Central Valley, the maximum temperature ( around 28 C ) is reached a little after midday and descends gradually to about 20 C around 7:00 p.m. It stays stable during the night and reaches the minimum ( around 18 C ) around 4:00 a.m., it overcomes the 20 C point at 7:00 a.m. and increases gradually to midday.
